# Space-Launch-API
## Check out the api
This api is hosted on [https://space-launch-api-f1lrotto.herokuapp.com](https://space-launch-api-f1lrotto.herokuapp.com). 

Please check the documentation bellow for more information. 
## Introduction
This is a **Space launch API** that can be used to get information about upcoming launches from **SpaceX** and even add and **manage your own launches**. It makes use of the **SpaceX API** to get the information about their upcoming launches.

For your own launches, you can **schedule your missions** to different habitable planets inside our splanet system. These planets were filtered from data by **NASA** about the discovered planets in our solar system. 

They were filtred on basis of the following criteria:
- koi_disposition === "CONFIRMED" 
- koi_insol > 0.36 
- koi_insol < 1.11 
- koi_prad < 1.6

(koi == Kepler Object of Interest)
## Usage
This API has 4 endpoints:

(these examples were shortened to make them more readable)

        "upcoming": false
    },
]
```
#### GET launches paginated
Make `GET` request to `https://space-launch-api-f1lrotto.herokuapp.com/launches?limit=10&page=18` to get the list of launches paginated. You need to pass limit and page as parameters.
##### Response:
```json
[
    {
        "flightNumber": 180,
        "customers": [
            "NASA",
            "NASA"
        ],
        "launchDate": "2022-09-20T00:00:00.000Z",
        "mission": "Psyche & Janus",
        "rocket": "Falcon 9",
        "success": null,
        "upcoming": true
    },
    {
        "flightNumber": 183,
        "customers": [
            "DigitalGlobe"
        ],
        "launchDate": "2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "mission": "WorldView Legion 1 & 2",
        "rocket": "Falcon 9",
        "success": null,
        "upcoming": true
    },
]
```
#### POST launch
Make `POST` request to `https://space-launch-api-f1lrotto.herokuapp.com/launches/` to add a new launch. You need to pass the following parameters:
```json
{
  "mission": "example mission",
  "rocket": "example rocket",
  "launchDate": "December 27, 2029",
  "target": "Kepler-1652 b"
}
```
##### Response:
```json
{
    "mission": "example mission",
    "rocket": "example rocket",
    "launchDate": "2029-12-26T23:00:00.000Z",
    "target": "Kepler-1652 b",
    "success": true,
    "upcoming": true,
    "customers": "NASA",
    "flightNumber": 195
}
```
#### DELETE launch
Make `DELETE` request to `https://space-launch-api-f1lrotto.herokuapp.com/launches/ID` to delete a launch. You need to pass the ID of the launch as a parameter.
##### Response:
```json
{
    "acknowledged": true,
    "modifiedCount": 1,
    "upsertedId": null,
    "upsertedCount": 0,
    "matchedCount": 1
}
```
Launch will be set as `upcoming` to false and `success` to false.
##### This is how the launch looks after deletion:
```json
    {
        "flightNumber": 195,
        "customers": [
            "NASA"
        ],
        "launchDate": "2029-12-26T23:00:00.000Z",
        "mission": "example mission",
        "rocket": "example rocket",
        "success": false,
        "target": "Kepler-1652 b",
        "upcoming": false
    }
```
### Technologies used
Backend of this API runns on **Node.js** with **express**.

This API stores the data in a **MongoDB** database, which is hosted on **Atlas**, and is interacted with by **Mongoose**.

To make requests to the **SpaceX API**, it's using axios, and to parse the csv file with planets from nasa, it uses **csv-parse**.

## Running the project

### Install the dependancies
```bash
npm install
``` 
### Creating .env file
You need to create a `.env` file in the `/src` directory

In this file you should include:
- `PORT` - on which the application will run on
- `MONGO_URL` - a connect URI to your mongoDB database
  
### Start the application 
```bash
npm start
```
### Start the application in development mode (hot-code reloading)
```bash
npm run dev
```
